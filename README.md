# Covid-19's impact on USD to Turkish Lira exchange rate

- At first, I found the future numbers by time series forecasting using the Covid-19 data in Turkey. 
- Likewise, I found the future values by time series forecasting using the Dollar / Turkish Lira exchange rate data. 
- Then, I gave the newly formed covid 19 data to the DNN model as an input and tried to find the future value of the Dollar / Turkish Lira exchange rate as the output.
- Finally, I compared the values of the Dollar / Turkish Lira exchange rate that we forecasted and predicted with DNN.
